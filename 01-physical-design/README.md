## Design Evolution (Concept to Diagram)

Before creating the digital topology, the physical design was first sketched by hand to validate:
- Layered architecture
- Device placement
- Physical connectivity assumptions

This mirrors real-world engineering workflows where whiteboarding precedes formal documentation.
