# Phase 1.5 — Bridge Skills (CAINO Track)

## Overview
This repository documents **Phase 1.5 Bridge Skills** for the **Chief AI Network Engineer Officer (CAINO)** track.

Phase 1.5 serves as the **critical transition layer** between foundational networking knowledge (Phase 1) and advanced infrastructure, security, and automation operations (Phase 2+). The focus is on **real-world, job-ready competencies** that are often assumed but rarely taught explicitly.

All work in this repository is structured as **hands-on, reproducible proof-of-work**, emphasizing practical workflows over theoretical study.

---

## Purpose of Phase 1.5
Phase 1.5 exists to eliminate skill gaps that commonly block:
- Entry into professional network/infrastructure roles
- Progression into security and automation domains
- Effective real-world troubleshooting and operations

This phase ensures that foundational knowledge is **operationalized**, documented, and verifiable.

---

## Core Focus Areas
Phase 1.5 bridge skills include (but are not limited to):

- **Networking Operations**
  - VLAN implementation and segmentation
  - Inter-VLAN routing
  - Trunking and access design
  - IP addressing validation and troubleshooting

- **Systems & Infrastructure Awareness**
  - Server roles and placement
  - Network services fundamentals (DNS, DHCP, NTP)
  - Physical vs logical topology alignment

- **Security Foundations**
  - Network hardening concepts
  - Access control awareness
  - Segmentation for security boundaries
  - Foundational security tooling exposure

- **Tooling & Workflow**
  - Draw.io network documentation
  - Packet Tracer limitations and workarounds
  - GitHub-based documentation standards
  - Screenshot-based verification of configurations

---

## Methodology
All labs and exercises follow these principles:

- **Hands-on first** — no passive learning
- **Document everything** — screenshots, configs, diagrams
- **Reproducible workflows** — clear steps from start to finish
- **Real-world alignment** — mapped to professional expectations

This repository intentionally avoids isolated practice labs and instead emphasizes **connected, operational scenarios**.

---

## Proof-of-Work Standards
Each lab or exercise includes:
- Clear objectives
- Step-by-step implementation
- Visual verification (screenshots/diagrams)
- Configuration outputs where applicable
- Notes on platform limitations (e.g., Packet Tracer)

All artifacts are designed to be reviewable by:
- Hiring managers
- Technical interviewers
- Future collaborators

---

## Relationship to the CAINO Track
- **Phase 1** → Foundational networking knowledge  
- **Phase 1.5** → Operational bridge skills (this repository)  
- **Phase 2+** → Advanced security, automation, and infrastructure engineering  

Phase 1.5 must be **completed in full** before advancing to Phase 2 to ensure technical depth without gaps.

---

## Status
🚧 **In Progress**  
This repository is actively being expanded as additional bridge skills are implemented and documented.
